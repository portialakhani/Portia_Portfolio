# My First Portfolio - starter project 🦄

this is a basic portfolio HTML starter, missing the styles. It already has assets, that you can change and add your own adjustments  
<br />

## What's in this project? 🌈

← `README.md`: That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `index.html`: This is the main HTML page for your site.

← `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to your content.

← `script.js`: If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript.

← `favicon.ico`: A favicon, also known as a shortcut icon, website icon, tab icon, URL icon, or bookmark icon, is a file containing one or more small icons, associated with a particular website or web page

← `assets folder`: Where you can place all of your cool images

<br />

## How does the final project should look like? 👩‍💻

You are free to change images, colors and text, but the final goal is to have something similar to this:

<img alt="Demo" src="WhatsApp Image 2023-02-17 at 00.58.42.png" />
  
<p></p>
